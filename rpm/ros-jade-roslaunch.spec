%description
roslaunch is a tool for easily launching multiple ROS nodes locally and remotely
via SSH, as well as setting parameters on the Parameter Server. It includes
options to automatically respawn processes that have already died. roslaunch
takes in one or more XML configuration files (with the .launch extension) that
specify the parameters to set and nodes to launch, as well as the machines that
they should be run on.

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
